  % ------------- SENTENCE 196
  \item[Sentence 196] \hfill \\
  {\bf John+} tricked {\bf Bill-} because he was mischievous.
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item When you're mischievous against something or someone it is almost always implied that the object is being mistreated or hurt by the subject. The predicate "tricked" will in this case most certainly imply to a human reader that John is behaving badly towards Bill.
  	\item There are two candidates for the incorrect answer and none for correct one. However, the two incorrect candidates are duplicate.
  	\item \insertcode{"Scripts/196/196-1.sentence"}{Context for $R_1$ and $R_2$ (duplicates).}
  	\item This is an article about Greek mythology which is probably unimportant for our sentence. The correct subject in this sentence is $They$, which points to something that is clarified in the context and not within the sentence (beautiful maiden nymphs). The correct object is $humans$. 
  	\item \insertcode{"Scripts/196/196-2.sentence"}{Target sentence in $R_1$ and $R_2$.}
  	\item The test sentence is of the form $X$ trick, $X$ mischievous. The corpus sentence is of the form $X$ mischievous towards, $X$ trick.
  	\item A predicate in English can be of the form {\bf $adjective$ towards} or {\bf $adjective$ against}. Is this considered?
  \end{itemize}

  \item[Sentence 201] \hfill \\
  {\bf Rick Davis-} campaigned for {\bf John McCain+} since he was the best man for office.
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item This sentence is only possible to resolve easily if we look among corpora related to politics.
  	\item With a good corpus this would be very easy to resolve if the object candidate was of the form {\bf man for office} instead of just {\bf man}. The latter case will be way too general and has nothing to do with this special kind of political situation our sentence describes.
  	\item The system should be able to make the comparison {\bf X man for office $\sim$ campaign for X} vs. {\bf X campaign for $\sim$ X man for office} instead of {\bf X man $\sim$ campaign for X} vs. {\bf X campaign for $\sim$ X man}. 
  \end{itemize}

  \item[Sentence 350] \hfill \\
  {\bf Claudia-} lost all her money to {\bf Valarie+} because she is really smart.
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item This sentence obviously has a lot of issues, since we have only 6 votes for the correct candidate, {\bf X smart $\sim$ lose to X}, but 142 votes for the incorrect one, {\bf X lose $\sim$ X smart}. However the logic behind the candidate comparison looks completely correct, and this should be easy to resolve.
  	\item It would be very interesting to make comparisons between negating opposites, for example: {\bf X lose $\sim$ X smart} vs. {\bf X lose $\sim$ X stupid}.
  	\item \insertcode{"Scripts/350/350-1.sentence"}{Context from $R_1$ and $R_2$.}
  	\item \insertcode{"Scripts/350/350-2.sentence"}{Target sentence for $R_1$ and $R_2$.}
  	\item Looking at this example, one issue could be that the object {\bf it} in the target sentence is an exophor and not an anaphor. It is not clear from either the sentence itself or the context of what we are smart about. 
  	\item Similar problem as with sentence 196, {\bf X smart} is not true here, instead we have the case of {\bf smart about X} or {\bf X smart about}
  	\item This sentence is a {\it concessive clause} determined by {\bf Even though}. {\it Even though they were smart about it, they lost some serious money} is equivalent to {\it They lost some serious money even though they were smart about it}.
  \end{itemize}

  \item[Sentence 443] \hfill \\
  The {\bf cheetah-} outran the {\bf antelope+} so it got eaten.
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item The comparison {\bf eat $\sim$ outrun X} vs. {\bf X outrun $\sim$ eat} makes no sense. Not sure if this sentence is actually translatable to a logic form since eat is conjugated to its passive form (eg. the antelope was eaten, the antelope got eaten, the antilope is being eaten, etc.), which is not the same thing as its corresponding active form (the antilope is eating, the antilope ate). However the system makes some kind of generalization here and suggests that "eating" in istself is an implication of {\it a cheetah that is outrunning} or {\it outrunning a cheetah}.
  	\item {\bf eat X $\sim$ outrun X} vs. {\bf X outrun $\sim$ eat X}?
  \end{itemize}

  \item[Sentence 70] \hfill \\
  {\bf Jimbo} was running from {\bf Bobbert+} because he smelled awful.
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item The problem here is that we are comparing {\bf X smell $\sim$ run from X} vs. {\bf X run $\sim$ smell X}. The verb {\it smell} can have several meanings depending on context. It can be sort-of reflexive and not at the same time, i.e. "He smells" can be equivalent to "He stinks" and "He is sensing a smell" at the same time; it depends on the context. 
  	\item {\bf X smell awful $\sim$ run from X} vs. {\bf X run $\sim$ X smell awful } would probably solve this problem.
  \end{itemize}

  \item[Sentence 407] \hfill \\
  {\bf Luigi+} rescued {\bf Mario-} because he was the only one who can.
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item This sentence is not gramatically correct. It should be {\it Luigi+ rescued Mario- because he was the only one who could}.
  	\item Current comparison is {\bf X one $\sim$ X rescue} vs. {\bf X one $\sim$ rescue X}. This is too vague.
  	\item Results would probably be better if the system compared {\bf X one who can $\sim$ X rescue} vs. {\bf X one who can $\sim$ rescue X}.
  \end{itemize}

  \item[Sentence 116] \hfill \\
  {\bf Bob-} sued {\bf Bill+} because he was embezzling funds. 
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item {\bf X embezzle $\sim$ sue X} vs. {\bf X embezzle $\sim$ X sue} looks completely correct. Nearest neighbor gives us 4 votes for the correct candidate and 10 votes for the incorrect one.
  	\item The incorrect candidate has ten votes, however most of them are duplicate. In reality there are only two incorrect matches. This is reoccurring in almost all sentences. Is it a front-end issue or something else?
  	\item \insertcode{"Scripts/116/116-1.sentence"}{Context of first incorrect vote.}
  	\item Noisy, but in this case it shouldn't be an issue, the target sentence contains all information we need.
  	\item \insertcode{"Scripts/116/116-2.sentence"}{Target sentence of first incorrect vote.}
  	\item This is interesting. The sentence follows the logical structure we are looking for, although everything crashes because of {\it suggesting}. The mayor is suing because the newspaper made an accusation of him embezzling, not because he was actually embezzling.
  	\item \insertcode{"Scripts/116/116-3.sentence"}{Context for remaining votes.}
  	\item  This text makes very little sense.
  \end{itemize}
