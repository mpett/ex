NON RESOLVABLE ISSUES:
123, 122: The sentiment issue here lies in the number of seasons a TV-series has been on the air. From world knowledge we can figure out that more seasons means we have a better series. 
they provide a good show (positive) --> 23 > 2 --> simpsons have property 23 --> the simpsons
We cannot figure this out using selectional preference alone.

174: mightier is not lemmatized into mighty.

107, 106: outran is not lemmatized into outrun.

62: shot is not lemmatized into shoot.

55: dependency (dobj,prefer,romney) is missing. Is this a simple bug or is the sentence not parsed correctly?

36, 37: funnier not lemmatized into funny 

INCORRECT:
152: Looks like an issue with the sentiment lexicon. To fire someone is negative while getting fired is positive? Otherwise this looks correct.

121: Would have been correct if there had been some sort of error handling for negation. (not able)

86, 87: These are difficult. I'm not sure how to annotate the pronoun here.

49: Sentence not parsed correctly

74, 75: The comparison is good, but the sentiment values looks completely crazy.
