When I read the story, I couldnï¿½t get the head or the tail of the storyï¿½.

He recalled that a reporter called him while he was in South Africa, to ask him about an amount of GHï¿½5,000 and he explained to the reporter, that regarding the GHï¿½5,000, he only fronted as the representative for COSGA to supplement a larger amount of money which was with K.K. Kabobo and other members to distribute as royalties in Kumasi.

This implied that he has never personally, processed any amount of money meant for royalties.

Anybody who knows the COSGA system and how money is disbursed will laugh at this storyï¿½.

Mark believes some people who have no idea of how things are done at COSGA, are behind it and they have made the editor a victim to perpetrate their selfish interest.

I will sue the editor in court for her to tell the court where she saw me embezzling any money, and show the court evidence that proves that.

A lot of journalists write false stories about people; they threaten to send them to court but nothing happens and they go scot free.

I am going to go all out to make sure the editor pays for being unprofessionalï¿½, Mark emphasized.
