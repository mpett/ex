The Court finds that De Rooy adequately disclosed the facts underlying her conclusion that Nicosia embezzled money from Jan KerouacÂ’s heirs.

Accusations of criminal activity, like other statements, are not actionable if the underlying facts are disclosed.

In re Yagman 796 F.2d 1165, 1174 (9th Cir.

1986); Dunn v. Gannett New York Newspapers 833 F.2d 446, 453-54 (3rd Cir.

1987).

In Dunn the mayor sued a newspaper for suggesting that the mayor embezzled funds.

The court found the statement not actionable, in part because the newspaper disclosed the basis for its conclusion.

U.

The basis of the newspaperÂ’s embezzlement allegation was that the city learned that funds were missing and the mayor ordered employees not to talk to the press.

U. Like the newspaper in Dunn, De Rooy has disclosed the underlying facts and allowed readers to decide for themselves whether the facts amounted to embezzlement.

The Court finds that De RooyÂ’s statements regarding embezzlement contained in ï¿½34 of the complaint are not actionable, and hereby GRANTS De RooyÂ’s motion to dismiss with respect to the same.
