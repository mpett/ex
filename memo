---------------------

Generic sentence (GS):
DO NOT express specific episode(sent1) or isolated facts(sent2).
sent1: “Merry is smoking a cigar.”
sent2: “The bomb caused chaos.”
DO report a kind of general property(sent3) or habit(sent4).
sent3: “potatoes contain protein.”
sent4: “Merry smokes cigar after dinner.”
Criteria of annotation:
1)according to the definition and your understanding of the sentence.
2)if the sentence included frequency adverb like “usually”, “typically”, or temporal modifier like “every night”, or modal verbs like “could”, “would”, “can”, the sentence would be annotated as generic sentence(g).
3)you could test the sentence by adding “usually” before the predicate, and if its meaning doesn’t change a lot, it could be generic sentence.

march wed 11: I started watching the stanford course by jurafsky instead of the columbia one with collins. Much better. I think it will take about two weeks to finish this course. While I'm watching I will attempt to write down thoughts related to the project and suggest improvements along the way, rather than looking at individual sentences from the result set.

So I guess the idea is to work with this for around two weeks and try to create some sort of list with suggestions. At this moment they're kind of vague, but it's better than nothing at all.

* edit distance, filtering on candidates, spell checking on scripts, implement probablistic models, make use of stuff such as google n-gram, try different corpora (newspaper vs fiction?) and compare the results. 

Oh yeah, and I reaaallly need to write that project specification.
