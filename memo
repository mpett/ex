Criteria of annotation:
1)according to the definition and your understanding of the sentence.
2)if the sentence included frequency adverb like “usually”, “typically”, or temporal modifier like “every night”, or modal verbs like “could”, “would”, “can”, the sentence would be annotated as generic sentence(g).
